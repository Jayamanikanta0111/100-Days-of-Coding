# 🚀 Day 1 – Search Algorithms in Python

Welcome to Day 1 of the 100 Days of Coding Challenge!  
Today’s focus is on understanding and implementing two fundamental search techniques in Python:

- **Linear Search**: A straightforward approach where each element is checked one by one.
- **Binary Search**: A faster method that works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## 📁 Files Included

- `linear_search.py`  
  Implements a simple linear search algorithm to find the index of a target value in a list.

- `binary_search.py`  
  Implements a binary search algorithm on a sorted list for efficient searching.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- Looping and conditionals
- Index tracking
- Efficiency comparison between Linear and Binary search
- Applying return values and print statements for feedback

---

## 📘 What I Learned

- How linear search checks each element sequentially
- How binary search uses a divide-and-conquer strategy
- The importance of list sorting before using binary search

---

## 🧠 Challenge Reflection

Choosing between linear and binary search depends on the context—linear works well for unsorted lists, while binary is optimal for sorted data. This day helped build intuition for time complexity and practical decision-making in algorithm selection.
